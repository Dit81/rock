What is needed:

1. User system with some access levels. Every action or shown page must have
minimal access level. Default - for frontend page 0 (it equal guest level), for
backend (admin) zone - 50. Superadmin have level 100. Blocked user have negative
access level, matching their previous level (blocked superadmin will have level
-100)

2. Static content system with access by matching url. This system must be
applied when no matching resources found.

3. Controllers, generating some frontend content must be registered as
ContentPage. It's necessary for common processing of 'siders' and assigning
access levels

4. Sider - registered view helper - is placed on webpage on the sides of
content.

5. Menu is complex thing. On the one hand - it is kind of sider, on th other -
it is link between content pages, users and other siders. It is base navigating
system of cms.

6. Admin zone for managing of all of them.
